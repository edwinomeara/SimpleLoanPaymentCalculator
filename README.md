# SimpleLoanPaymentCalculator

A simple loan calculator developed as a fun project to help myself learn iOS development.

Enables users to save their input with Core Data for the ability to monitor and compare their loans.  Uses graphs to help visualize their loans overtime and an amortization table to view what their money is being paid towards each payment cycle.
